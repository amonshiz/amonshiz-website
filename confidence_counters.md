# Confidence Counters
Ever have one of those weeks that makes you feel like you have accomplished nothing? Like, you spend the time but it just seems to have disappeared into waste?

Yeah, this was one of those weeks.

I know they happen but they are no fun. I believe that I’m generally pretty competent at my job, but there are times where it feels like I’m totally out of my depth. Maybe I am?

But if so, then that is where I want to be. I have grown the most in this kind of situation before. The lows hit the confidence counter a bit.
